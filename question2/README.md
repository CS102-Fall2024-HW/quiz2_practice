# Question 2

## Partial Reversal (50 points)
When playing Scrabble, a player tends to swap letters around. To assist in finding words, you decide to write a partial reversal function. This function, ```void partialReversal(string s[], int start, int end)```, reverses part of a string that starts at index ```start``` and stops at index ```end```. Your main should be able to take these variables as inputs and print out the final value of the string ```s```.  

Sample Input: ```SC102 0 1```  
Sample Output: ```CS102```  

Bonus (+10): Handle the cases where you have invalid inputs and print out “Invalid Input.”  

Sample Input: ```SC102 5 3```  
Sample Output: ```Invalid Input.```
