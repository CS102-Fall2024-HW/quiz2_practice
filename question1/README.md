# Question 1

## Hexadecimal Counting (50 points)
Write a function, hexCounting(int start, int end, int increment) that prints the counts starting at the start integer, ends at the end integer, and increments by the increment variable. The counts should be printed and separated by a space. Your main should be able to take these variables as inputs.  

Hint: You can just use %x in printf to convert to hexadecimal.  

Sample Input: ```0 30 3```  
Sample Output: ```0 3 6 9 c f 12 15 18 1b 1e```
